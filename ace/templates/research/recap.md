# Project Research Recap

**Project:** [name from brief.md]
**Domain:** [inferred domain type]
**Researched:** [date]
**Confidence:** [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]

## Executive Summary

[2-3 paragraph overview of research findings]

- What type of product this is and how experts build it
- The recommended approach based on research
- Key risks and how to mitigate them

## Key Findings

### Recommended Stack

[Summary from STACK.md — 1-2 paragraphs]

**Core technologies:**
- [Technology]: [purpose] — [why recommended]
- [Technology]: [purpose] — [why recommended]
- [Technology]: [purpose] — [why recommended]

### Expected Features

[Summary from FEATURES.md]

**Must have (table stakes):**
- [Feature] — users expect this
- [Feature] — users expect this

**Should have (competitive):**
- [Feature] — differentiator
- [Feature] — differentiator

**Defer (v2+):**
- [Feature] — not essential for launch

### Architecture Approach

[Summary from ARCHITECTURE.md — 1 paragraph]

**Major components:**
1. [Component] — [responsibility]
2. [Component] — [responsibility]
3. [Component] — [responsibility]

### Critical Pitfalls

[Top 3-5 from PITFALLS.md]

1. **[Pitfall]** — [how to avoid]
2. **[Pitfall]** — [how to avoid]
3. **[Pitfall]** — [how to avoid]

### UX/DX Insights

[Summary from UX.md]

**Type:** [UX (UI project) or DX (CLI/API/Library)]

**Key patterns:**
- [Pattern] — [evidence]
- [Pattern] — [evidence]

**Emotional design:** [Primary emotion] (avoid: [Anti-emotion])

**Critical flow:** [Most important flow] — [friction tolerance]

## Implications for Track

Based on research, suggested stage structure:

### Stage 1: [Name]
**Rationale:** [why this comes first based on research]
**Delivers:** [what this stage produces]
**Addresses:** [features from FEATURES.md]
**Avoids:** [pitfall from PITFALLS.md]

### Stage 2: [Name]
**Rationale:** [why this order]
**Delivers:** [what this stage produces]
**Uses:** [stack elements from STACK.md]
**Implements:** [architecture component]

### Stage 3: [Name]
**Rationale:** [why this order]
**Delivers:** [what this stage produces]

[Continue for suggested stages...]

### Stage Ordering Rationale

- [Why this order based on dependencies discovered]
- [Why this grouping based on architecture patterns]
- [How this avoids pitfalls from research]

### Research Flags

Stages likely needing deeper research during planning:
- **Stage [X]:** [reason — e.g., "complex integration, needs API research"]
- **Stage [Y]:** [reason — e.g., "niche domain, sparse documentation"]

Stages with standard patterns (skip research-stage):
- **Stage [X]:** [reason — e.g., "well-documented, established patterns"]

## Confidence Assessment

| Area | Confidence | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| Stack | [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW] | [reason] |
| Features | [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW] | [reason] |
| Architecture | [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW] | [reason] |
| Pitfalls | [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW] | [reason] |
| UX/DX | [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW] | [reason] |

**Overall confidence:** [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]

### Gaps to Address

[Any areas where research was inconclusive or needs validation during implementation]

- [Gap]: [how to handle during planning/execution]
- [Gap]: [how to handle during planning/execution]

## Sources

### Primary (HIGH confidence)
- [Context7 library ID] — [topics]
- [Official docs URL] — [what was checked]

### Secondary (MEDIUM confidence)
- [Source] — [finding]

### Tertiary (LOW confidence)
- [Source] — [finding, needs validation]

<guidelines>

**Executive Summary:**
- Write for someone who will only read this section
- Include the key recommendation and main risk
- 2-3 paragraphs maximum

**Key Findings:**
- Summarize, don't duplicate full documents
- Link to detailed docs (STACK.md, FEATURES.md, UX.md, etc.)
- Focus on what matters for track decisions

**Implications for Track:**
- This is the most important section
- Directly informs track creation
- Be explicit about stage suggestions and rationale
- Include research flags for each suggested stage

**Confidence Assessment:**
- Be honest about uncertainty
- Note gaps that need resolution during planning
- HIGH = verified with official sources
- MEDIUM = community consensus, multiple sources agree
- LOW = single source or inference

**Integration with track creation:**
- This file is loaded as context during track creation
- Stage suggestions here become starting point for track
- Research flags inform stage planning

</guidelines>
