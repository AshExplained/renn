<purpose>
Set up monitoring for a deployed project in 3 phases:

1. **ASK** -- Present project context, detect stack/platform, user selects monitoring scope
2. **RESEARCH & PLAN** -- Investigate monitoring tools, generate setup checklist
3. **WALK CHECKLIST** -- Execute auto items, gate on human items, track progress

All three phases are fully implemented.
</purpose>

<core_principle>
Context-aware recommendations, user decides scope. Detect the project stack and deployment platform automatically, but the user always declares what kind of monitoring they want. Persist the declaration so Phase 2 can research without re-asking.
</core_principle>

<process>

<step name="detect_existing_watch" priority="first">

Check for existing watch artifacts:

```bash
[ -f .ace/watch-plan.md ] && echo "EXISTING_PLAN" || echo "NO_PLAN"
[ -f .ace/watch-scope.md ] && echo "EXISTING_SCOPE" || echo "NO_SCOPE"
```

**Case 1: `.ace/watch-plan.md` exists (plan already generated)**

Read the file to extract the previous scope and status:
```bash
head -20 .ace/watch-plan.md
cat .ace/watch-scope.md 2>/dev/null
```

Present options via AskUserQuestion:
- header: "Existing Watch Plan"
- question: "Found an existing monitoring plan. What would you like to do?"
- options:
  - "Resume" (description: "Continue where you left off")
  - "Start fresh" (description: "Delete existing plan and start over")
  - "Add more tools" (description: "Keep existing monitoring, add new tools")

**If "Resume":** Skip to `phase_3_walk_checklist`. Plan exists, Phases 1-2 are done.

**If "Start fresh":** Delete all watch artifacts and continue to phase_1_ask:
```bash
rm -f .ace/watch-plan.md .ace/watch-scope.md .ace/watch-research.md
```

**If "Add more tools":** Delete watch-plan.md and watch-research.md but PRESERVE watch-scope.md. Update watch-scope.md to set `**Mode:** add-more` (replacing any existing Mode line, or appending if none). Continue to `phase_2_research_plan` (Phase 2 reads the mode flag and does additive research).

**Case 2: `.ace/watch-scope.md` exists but `.ace/watch-plan.md` does NOT**

Scope declared but plan not yet generated. Display: "Found existing scope declaration. Continuing to research and plan generation..." and skip to `phase_2_research_plan`.

**Case 3: Neither file exists** -- Continue to `phase_1_ask`.

</step>

<step name="phase_1_ask">

Phase 1 has 4 sub-steps: detect project context, present summary, select monitoring scope, persist scope.

**Sub-step 1a: Detect project context (WATCH-01, WATCH-02)**

Attempt to read project context from ACE state files:
```bash
PROJECT_NAME=$(head -1 .ace/brief.md 2>/dev/null | sed 's/^# //')
PLATFORM=$(grep -m1 '^\*\*Platform:\*\*' .ace/brief.md 2>/dev/null | sed 's/\*\*Platform:\*\* //')
SHIP_TARGET=$(grep -m1 '^\*\*Target:\*\*' .ace/ship-target.md 2>/dev/null | sed 's/\*\*Target:\*\* //')
STACK=$(grep -m1 '^\*\*Stack detected:\*\*' .ace/ship-target.md 2>/dev/null | sed 's/\*\*Stack detected:\*\* //')
WHAT_THIS_IS=$(sed -n '/## What This Is/,/^##/p' .ace/brief.md 2>/dev/null | head -5 | tail -4)
```

**If PROJECT_NAME is non-empty (ACE context exists):**
- Use extracted values for project summary
- If SHIP_TARGET is non-empty: use it as the deployment platform
- If SHIP_TARGET is empty but PLATFORM is non-empty: use PLATFORM
- If neither: ask user where the project is deployed (single AskUserQuestion)

**If PROJECT_NAME is empty (no ACE context -- WATCH-02 fallback):**

Ask the user directly via AskUserQuestion (maximum 2 questions):

1. header: "Project Info" / question: "No ACE project context found. What's your project's tech stack? (e.g., Next.js with Supabase, Django with PostgreSQL, Express with MongoDB)"
   Use the response as STACK. Set PROJECT_NAME to "Your project".

2. header: "Deployment Platform" / question: "Where is your project deployed?"
   options: "Vercel" (Static sites, Next.js, serverless) | "Railway" (Full-stack apps, databases) | "Fly.io" (Docker containers, global edge) | "AWS" (EC2, ECS, Lambda, etc.) | "Other" (Tell me where it's deployed)
   If "Other": ask follow-up for the platform name. Use the response as SHIP_TARGET.

---

**Sub-step 1b: Present project summary**

Display the detected or user-provided context:
```
## Your Project

**{PROJECT_NAME}**
{WHAT_THIS_IS or ""}

**Stack:** {STACK or PLATFORM}
**Deployed to:** {SHIP_TARGET or "unknown"}
```
If no description is available (no brief.md), omit the description line.

---

**Sub-step 1c: Select monitoring scope (WATCH-03)**

Present monitoring scope options via AskUserQuestion:
- header: "Monitoring Scope"
- question: "What monitoring do you want to set up for {PROJECT_NAME}?"
- options:
  - "Errors + Uptime" (description: "Recommended -- error tracking and health checks cover 80% of issues")
  - "Full observability" (description: "Errors, uptime, analytics, and performance monitoring")
  - "Just error tracking" (description: "Catch and alert on runtime errors only")
  - "Other" (description: "Tell me what you want to monitor")

If "Other": ask follow-up with header "Custom Monitoring" / question "What do you want to monitor? (e.g., database performance, API latency, user analytics)"

Use the response as MONITORING_SCOPE. No monitoring tool names in Phase 1 -- the scope question asks WHAT to monitor, not WHICH tools to use. Phase 2 (scout research) determines specific tools.

---

**Sub-step 1d: Persist scope to watch-scope.md**

Write `.ace/watch-scope.md`:
```markdown
# Watch Scope

**Project:** {PROJECT_NAME}
**Platform:** {SHIP_TARGET}
**Stack:** {STACK}
**Monitoring scope:** {MONITORING_SCOPE}
**Declared:** {YYYY-MM-DD}
**Status:** awaiting-plan
```

Do NOT create `.ace/watch-plan.md` -- that is Phase 2's responsibility.

Display Phase 1 completion:
```
Monitoring scope declared: {MONITORING_SCOPE}

Continuing to Phase 2 (Research & Plan)...
```

</step>

<step name="phase_2_research_plan">

Phase 2 reads the declared monitoring scope, researches tools via ace-stage-scout, and generates a monitoring checklist.

---

**Sub-step 2a: Read scope and validate**

Read `.ace/watch-scope.md` to extract monitoring scope and project context:

```bash
PROJECT=$(grep -m1 '^\*\*Project:\*\*' .ace/watch-scope.md | sed 's/\*\*Project:\*\* //')
PLATFORM=$(grep -m1 '^\*\*Platform:\*\*' .ace/watch-scope.md | sed 's/\*\*Platform:\*\* //')
STACK=$(grep -m1 '^\*\*Stack:\*\*' .ace/watch-scope.md | sed 's/\*\*Stack:\*\* //')
SCOPE=$(grep -m1 '^\*\*Monitoring scope:\*\*' .ace/watch-scope.md | sed 's/\*\*Monitoring scope:\*\* //')
STATUS=$(grep -m1 '^\*\*Status:\*\*' .ace/watch-scope.md | sed 's/\*\*Status:\*\* //')
MODE=$(grep -m1 '^\*\*Mode:\*\*' .ace/watch-scope.md 2>/dev/null | sed 's/\*\*Mode:\*\* //')
```

**Status routing:**

- **If STATUS is `plan-ready`:** `.ace/watch-plan.md` already exists. Skip Phase 2 entirely and continue to Phase 3.
- **If STATUS is not `awaiting-plan` and not `plan-ready`:** Warn "Unexpected status '{STATUS}' in watch-scope.md, continuing anyway." and proceed.
- **If SCOPE is empty:** Error "No monitoring scope found in watch-scope.md. Run /ace.watch again to declare a scope." and stop execution.

---

**Sub-step 2b: Gather context for research prompt**

```bash
PROJECT_NAME=$(head -1 .ace/brief.md 2>/dev/null | sed 's/^# //')
WHAT_THIS_IS=$(sed -n '/## What This Is/,/^##/p' .ace/brief.md 2>/dev/null | head -5 | tail -4)
MODEL_PROFILE=$(cat .ace/config.json 2>/dev/null | grep -o '"horsepower"[[:space:]]*:[[:space:]]*"[^"]*"' | grep -o '"[^"]*"$' | tr -d '"' || echo "balanced")
```

Resolve scout model from horsepower profile:

| horsepower | scout model |
|------------|-------------|
| max | opus |
| balanced | sonnet |
| eco | haiku |

---

**Sub-step 2c: Construct and spawn scout**

Construct a monitoring-specific research prompt with XML sections:

```markdown
<objective>
Research monitoring tools and setup steps for a {stack} project deployed on {platform}.

Answer: "What are the exact steps to set up {monitoring_scope} monitoring for this project?"
</objective>

<project_context>
**Project:** {project_name}
**Description:** {what_this_is}
**Stack:** {stack}
**Platform:** {platform}
**Monitoring scope:** {monitoring_scope}
</project_context>

<research_focus>
Research monitoring tools and setup for this specific stack and platform:

1. **Error tracking** -- SDK integration, source maps, alert configuration
2. **Uptime monitoring** -- Health check endpoints, ping services, status pages
3. **Analytics** (if scope includes) -- Page views, events, privacy-friendly options
4. **Performance monitoring** (if scope includes) -- Core Web Vitals, API latency, slow queries

For each tool:
- **Free tier limits** (mandatory) -- what is included free
- **Setup steps** -- exact CLI commands, SDK installation, config file changes
- **Automation potential** -- can this be fully set up via CLI/API, or does it require browser signup?

**CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:**
- Recommend FREE TIER tools only. Solo dev, not enterprise.
- Prefer tools with CLI/API setup over dashboard-only tools.
- Prefer tools that are widely adopted and well-documented.
- For every step, note whether it can be done via CLI/API (automatable by Claude) or requires human action (browser signup, credential retrieval, etc.).

{add_more_context}
</research_focus>

<output>
Write findings to: .ace/watch-research.md

Structure as numbered monitoring setup steps with:
- Tool name and free tier details
- Setup steps (CLI commands or human instructions)
- Whether each step is automatable via CLI/API or requires human action
- Verification method (how to confirm the tool is working)
- Common failure modes
</output>
```

**If MODE is "add-more":** Replace `{add_more_context}` with the following section:

```markdown
**EXISTING MONITORING (do not duplicate):**
The project already has monitoring set up. The user wants to ADD MORE tools.
Do NOT recommend tools that are already configured. Focus on gaps and complementary tools.

Already configured:
{existing_tools from watch-scope.md "Existing tools:" field}
```

Read the `**Existing tools:**` field from watch-scope.md:

```bash
EXISTING_TOOLS=$(sed -n '/^\*\*Existing tools:\*\*/,/^\*\*/p' .ace/watch-scope.md | head -20)
```

**If MODE is not "add-more" (or absent):** Replace `{add_more_context}` with an empty string.

Spawn the scout:

```
Task(
  prompt=research_prompt,
  subagent_type="ace-stage-scout",
  model="{scout_model}",
  description="Research monitoring tools for {stack} on {platform}"
)
```

---

**Sub-step 2d: Handle scout return**

**If scout returns `## RESEARCH COMPLETE`:**

Display: "Research complete. Converting to monitoring checklist..."

Continue to checklist conversion below.

**If scout returns `## RESEARCH BLOCKED`:**

Display the blocker message from the scout's return. Then offer recovery options using AskUserQuestion:

- header: "Research Blocked"
- question: "The scout could not complete research for monitoring on {platform}. How would you like to proceed?"
- options:
  - "Retry research" (description: "Spawn the scout again with the same prompt")
  - "Enter plan manually" (description: "Create .ace/watch-plan.md yourself and resume")
  - "Abort" (description: "Stop the watch workflow")

**If "Retry research":** Return to sub-step 2c and spawn the scout again.

**If "Enter plan manually":** Display instructions for the expected watch-plan.md format, then stop. User creates the file and runs /ace.watch again (detect_existing_watch will find it).

**If "Abort":** Stop the workflow with message "Watch workflow aborted. Run /ace.watch to start again."

---

**Sub-step 2e: Convert research to checklist**

Read `.ace/watch-research.md` and convert the scout's monitoring research into a numbered, classified checklist. This is deterministic workflow logic performed by the orchestrator (Claude running the workflow), not another agent spawn.

**Auto/gate classification table:**

| Step Type | Tag | Rationale |
|-----------|-----|-----------|
| npm/pip/gem package install | `[auto]` | Claude runs package managers |
| SDK initialization code (write config file) | `[auto]` | Claude has Write tool |
| Create health check endpoint | `[auto]` | Claude writes code |
| Install CLI tool (e.g., `npm i -g @sentry/wizard`) | `[auto]` | Claude runs CLI |
| Configure source maps upload in build | `[auto]` | Claude modifies build config |
| Create .env entries for tool keys | `[auto]` | Claude uses Write tool |
| Set environment variables on platform via CLI | `[auto]` | Claude runs `vercel env add`, `railway variables set`, etc. |
| Git commit monitoring config | `[auto]` | Claude runs git commands |
| Account signup (Sentry, UptimeRobot, etc.) | `[gate]` | Requires browser, human identity |
| Retrieve API key/DSN from dashboard | `[gate]` | User must copy from dashboard |
| Connect external integrations (Slack, PagerDuty) | `[gate]` | OAuth flow, browser required |
| Configure alerting thresholds in dashboard | `[gate]` | Dashboard-only for most tools |
| DNS record for status page subdomain | `[gate]` | Domain registrar, propagation |
| Verify alerts are received (trigger test alert) | `[gate]` | Human confirms notification arrived |
| Visual check of monitoring dashboard | `[gate]` | Human judges if data flows correctly |

**Key rule:** When a step can be done EITHER via dashboard OR via CLI, classify as `[auto]` and use the CLI approach. Only classify as `[gate]` when NO CLI/API alternative exists.

**Conversion process:**

1. Read `.ace/watch-research.md`
2. Parse monitoring setup steps from the research
3. Classify each step as `[auto]` or `[gate]` using the table above
4. Number sequentially across all sections
5. Group into logical sections: Prerequisites, SDK Integration, Platform Configuration, Verification
6. For gate items, add an `Instructions:` sub-bullet with human-facing text explaining what the user must do
7. Target 8-15 total checklist items. Group related micro-steps into single items. Each item should be one logical action.

Write `.ace/watch-plan.md` with this format:

```markdown
# Watch Plan

**Project:** {PROJECT_NAME}
**Platform:** {PLATFORM}
**Stack:** {STACK}
**Monitoring scope:** {MONITORING_SCOPE}
**Created:** {YYYY-MM-DD}
**Status:** ready

## Prerequisites

- [ ] 1. [auto/gate] {step description}

## SDK Integration

- [ ] N. [auto/gate] {step description}

## Platform Configuration

- [ ] N. [auto/gate] {step description}

## Verification

- [ ] N. [gate/auto] {step description}
  - Instructions: {what the user needs to verify}

---
*Generated by /ace.watch Phase 2*
*Research source: ace-stage-scout*
```

Gate items always include the `Instructions:` sub-bullet. Auto items do not need it (Claude will execute them directly).

---

**Sub-step 2f: Update status and display**

Update watch-scope.md status:

```bash
sed -i 's/^\*\*Status:\*\* awaiting-plan/\*\*Status:\*\* plan-ready/' .ace/watch-scope.md
```

Count auto and gate items:

```bash
AUTO_COUNT=$(grep -c '\[auto\]' .ace/watch-plan.md)
GATE_COUNT=$(grep -c '\[gate\]' .ace/watch-plan.md)
TOTAL=$((AUTO_COUNT + GATE_COUNT))
```

Display completion message:

```
Plan generated: .ace/watch-plan.md
{TOTAL} total steps ({AUTO_COUNT} auto, {GATE_COUNT} gate)
```

Display: "Continuing to Phase 3..."

Then proceed to `phase_3_walk_checklist`.

</step>

<step name="phase_3_walk_checklist">

**Phase 3: Walk Checklist** (implemented in Stage 43)

This phase will:
1. Read .ace/watch-plan.md
2. Walk checklist items: auto-execute or present gates
3. Track progress with checkboxes and timestamps
4. Handle error recovery (retry/skip/abort)
5. Update pulse.md with monitoring progress

Display: "Phase 3 (Walk Checklist) will be available after Stage 43."

</step>
