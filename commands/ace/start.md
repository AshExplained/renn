<objective>

Initialize a new project through unified flow: questioning → research (optional) → requirements → track.

This is the most leveraged moment in any project. Deep questioning here means better runs, better execution, better outcomes. One command takes you from idea to ready-for-planning.

**Creates:**
- `.ace/brief.md` — project context
- `.ace/config.json` — workflow preferences
- `.ace/recon/` — domain research (optional)
- `.ace/specs.md` — scoped requirements
- `.ace/track.md` — stage structure
- `.ace/pulse.md` — project memory

**After this command:** Run `/ace.plan-stage 1` to start execution.

</objective>

<execution_context>

@~/.claude/ace/references/questioning.md
@~/.claude/ace/references/ui-brand.md
@~/.claude/ace/templates/brief.md
@~/.claude/ace/templates/specs.md

</execution_context>

<process>

## Stage 1: Setup

**MANDATORY FIRST STEP — Execute these checks before ANY user interaction:**

1. **Abort if project exists:**
   ```bash
   [ -f .ace/brief.md ] && echo "ERROR: Project already initialized. Use /ace.status" && exit 1
   ```

2. **Initialize git repo in THIS directory** (required even if inside a parent repo):
   ```bash
   if [ -d .git ] || [ -f .git ]; then
       echo "Git repo exists in current directory"
   else
       git init
       echo "Initialized new git repo"
   fi
   ```

3. **Detect existing code (brownfield detection):**
   ```bash
   CODE_FILES=$(find . -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.py" -o -name "*.go" -o -name "*.rs" -o -name "*.swift" -o -name "*.java" 2>/dev/null | grep -v node_modules | grep -v .git | head -20)
   HAS_PACKAGE=$([ -f package.json ] || [ -f requirements.txt ] || [ -f Cargo.toml ] || [ -f go.mod ] || [ -f Package.swift ] && echo "yes")
   HAS_CODEBASE_MAP=$([ -d .ace/codebase ] && echo "yes")
   ```

   **You MUST run all bash commands above using the Bash tool before proceeding.**

## Stage 2: Brownfield Offer

**If existing code detected and .ace/codebase/ doesn't exist:**

Check the results from setup step:
- If `CODE_FILES` is non-empty OR `HAS_PACKAGE` is "yes"
- AND `HAS_CODEBASE_MAP` is NOT "yes"

Use AskUserQuestion:
- header: "Existing Code"
- question: "I detected existing code in this directory. Would you like to map the codebase first?"
- options:
  - "Map codebase first" — Run /ace.map-codebase to understand existing architecture (Recommended)
  - "Skip mapping" — Proceed with project initialization

**If "Map codebase first":**
```
Run `/ace.map-codebase` first, then return to `/ace.start`
```
Exit command.

**If "Skip mapping":** Continue to Stage 3.

**If no existing code detected OR codebase already mapped:** Continue to Stage 3.

## Stage 3: Deep Questioning

**Display stage banner:**

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 ACE ► QUESTIONING
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**Open the conversation:**

Ask inline (freeform, NOT AskUserQuestion):

"What do you want to build?"

Wait for their response. This gives you the context needed to ask intelligent follow-up questions.

**Follow the thread:**

Based on what they said, ask follow-up questions that dig into their response. Use AskUserQuestion with options that probe what they mentioned — interpretations, clarifications, concrete examples.

Keep following threads. Each answer opens new threads to explore. Ask about:
- What excited them
- What problem sparked this
- What they mean by vague terms
- What it would actually look like
- What's already decided

Consult `questioning.md` for techniques:
- Challenge vagueness
- Make abstract concrete
- Surface assumptions
- Find edges
- Reveal motivation

**Check context (background, not out loud):**

As you go, mentally check the context checklist from `questioning.md`. If gaps remain, weave questions naturally. Don't suddenly switch to checklist mode.

**Decision gate:**

When you could write a clear brief.md, use AskUserQuestion:

- header: "Ready?"
- question: "I think I understand what you're after. Ready to create brief.md?"
- options:
  - "Create brief.md" — Let's move forward
  - "Keep exploring" — I want to share more / ask me more

If "Keep exploring" — ask what they want to add, or identify gaps and probe naturally.

Loop until "Create brief.md" selected.

## Stage 4: Write brief.md

Synthesize all context into `.ace/brief.md` using the template from `templates/brief.md`.

**For greenfield projects:**

Initialize requirements as hypotheses:

```markdown
## Requirements

### Validated

(None yet — ship to validate)

### Active

- [ ] [Requirement 1]
- [ ] [Requirement 2]
- [ ] [Requirement 3]

### Out of Scope

- [Exclusion 1] — [why]
- [Exclusion 2] — [why]
```

All Active requirements are hypotheses until shipped and validated.

**For brownfield projects (codebase map exists):**

Infer Validated requirements from existing code:

1. Read `.ace/codebase/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `STACK.md`
2. Identify what the codebase already does
3. These become the initial Validated set

```markdown
## Requirements

### Validated

- ✓ [Existing capability 1] — existing
- ✓ [Existing capability 2] — existing
- ✓ [Existing capability 3] — existing

### Active

- [ ] [New requirement 1]
- [ ] [New requirement 2]

### Out of Scope

- [Exclusion 1] — [why]
```

**Key Decisions:**

Initialize with any decisions made during questioning:

```markdown
## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| [Choice from questioning] | [Why] | — Pending |
```

**Last updated footer:**

```markdown
---
*Last updated: [date] after initialization*
```

Do not compress. Capture everything gathered.

**Commit brief.md:**

```bash
mkdir -p .ace
git add .ace/brief.md
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
docs: initialize project

[One-liner from brief.md What This Is section]
EOF
)"
```

## Stage 5: Workflow Preferences

**Round 1 — Core workflow settings (4 questions):**

```
questions: [
  {
    header: "Style",
    question: "How do you want to work?",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "Turbo (Recommended)", description: "Auto-approve, just execute" },
      { label: "Guided", description: "Confirm at each step" }
    ]
  },
  {
    header: "Depth",
    question: "How thorough should planning be?",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "Quick", description: "Ship fast (3-5 stages, 1-3 runs each)" },
      { label: "Standard", description: "Balanced scope and speed (5-8 stages, 3-5 runs each)" },
      { label: "Comprehensive", description: "Thorough coverage (8-12 stages, 5-10 runs each)" }
    ]
  },
  {
    header: "Execution",
    question: "Run batches in parallel?",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "Parallel (Recommended)", description: "Independent runs execute simultaneously" },
      { label: "Sequential", description: "One run at a time" }
    ]
  },
  {
    header: "Git Tracking",
    question: "Commit planning docs to git?",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "Yes (Recommended)", description: "Planning docs tracked in version control" },
      { label: "No", description: "Keep .ace/ local-only (add to .gitignore)" }
    ]
  }
]
```

**Round 2 — Workflow agents:**

These spawn additional agents during planning/execution. They add tokens and time but improve quality.

| Agent | When it runs | What it does |
|-------|--------------|--------------|
| **Scout** | Before planning each stage | Investigates domain, finds patterns, surfaces gotchas |
| **Run Reviewer** | After run is created | Verifies run actually achieves the stage goal |
| **Auditor** | After stage execution | Confirms must-haves were delivered |

All recommended for important projects. Skip for quick experiments.

```
questions: [
  {
    header: "Recon",
    question: "Research before planning each stage? (adds tokens/time)",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "Yes (Recommended)", description: "Investigate domain, find patterns, surface gotchas" },
      { label: "No", description: "Plan directly from requirements" }
    ]
  },
  {
    header: "Run Review",
    question: "Verify runs will achieve their goals? (adds tokens/time)",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "Yes (Recommended)", description: "Catch gaps before execution starts" },
      { label: "No", description: "Execute runs without verification" }
    ]
  },
  {
    header: "Auditor",
    question: "Verify work satisfies requirements after each stage? (adds tokens/time)",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "Yes (Recommended)", description: "Confirm deliverables match stage goals" },
      { label: "No", description: "Trust execution, skip verification" }
    ]
  },
  {
    header: "Horsepower",
    question: "Which AI models for planning agents?",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "Balanced (Recommended)", description: "Sonnet for most agents — good quality/cost ratio" },
      { label: "Max", description: "Opus for recon/navigator — higher cost, deeper analysis" },
      { label: "Eco", description: "Haiku where possible — fastest, lowest cost" }
    ]
  }
]
```

Create `.ace/config.json` with all settings:

```json
{
  "style": "turbo|guided",
  "depth": "quick|standard|comprehensive",
  "parallelization": true|false,
  "commit_docs": true|false,
  "horsepower": "max|balanced|eco",
  "checks": {
    "recon": true|false,
    "review": true|false,
    "auditor": true|false
  }
}
```

**If commit_docs = No:**
- Set `commit_docs: false` in config.json
- Add `.ace/` to `.gitignore` (create if needed)

**If commit_docs = Yes:**
- No additional gitignore entries needed

**Commit config.json:**

```bash
git add .ace/config.json
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
chore: add project config

Style: [chosen style]
Depth: [chosen depth]
Parallelization: [enabled/disabled]
Workflow agents: recon=[on/off], review=[on/off], auditor=[on/off]
EOF
)"
```

**Note:** Run `/ace.settings` anytime to update these preferences.

## Stage 5.5: Resolve Horsepower

Read horsepower setting for agent spawning:

```bash
HORSEPOWER=$(cat .ace/config.json 2>/dev/null | grep -o '"horsepower"[[:space:]]*:[[:space:]]*"[^"]*"' | grep -o '"[^"]*"$' | tr -d '"' || echo "balanced")
```

Default to "balanced" if not set.

**Model lookup table:**

| Agent | max | balanced | eco |
|-------|-----|----------|-----|
| ace-project-scout | opus | sonnet | haiku |
| ace-synthesizer | sonnet | sonnet | haiku |
| ace-navigator | opus | sonnet | sonnet |

Store resolved models for use in Task calls below.

## Stage 6: Recon Decision

Use AskUserQuestion:
- header: "Recon"
- question: "Research the domain ecosystem before defining requirements?"
- options:
  - "Recon first (Recommended)" — Discover standard stacks, expected features, architecture patterns
  - "Skip recon" — I know this domain well, go straight to requirements

**If "Recon first":**

Display stage banner:
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 ACE ► RESEARCHING

```

Create recon directory:
```bash
mkdir -p .ace/recon
```

**Determine milestone context:**

Check if this is greenfield or subsequent milestone:
- If no "Validated" requirements in brief.md → Greenfield (building from scratch)
- If "Validated" requirements exist → Subsequent milestone (adding to existing app)

Display spawning indicator:
```

**If "Skip recon":** Continue to Stage 7.

## Stage 7: Define Requirements

Display stage banner:
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 ACE ► DEFINING REQUIREMENTS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**Load context:**

Read brief.md and extract:
- Core value (the ONE thing that must work)
- Stated constraints (budget, timeline, tech limitations)
- Any explicit scope boundaries

**If recon exists:** Read recon/features.md and extract feature categories.

**Present features by category:**

```
Here are the features for [domain]:

## Authentication
**Table stakes:**
- Sign up with email/password
- Email verification
- Password reset
- Session management

**Differentiators:**
- Magic link login
- OAuth (Google, GitHub)
- 2FA

**Recon notes:** [any relevant notes]

---

## [Next Category]
...
```

**If no recon:** Gather requirements through conversation instead.

Ask: "What are the main things users need to be able to do?"

For each capability mentioned:
- Ask clarifying questions to make it specific
- Probe for related capabilities
- Group into categories

**Scope each category:**

For each category, use AskUserQuestion:

- header: "[Category name]"
- question: "Which [category] features are in v1?"
- multiSelect: true
- options:
  - "[Feature 1]" — [brief description]
  - "[Feature 2]" — [brief description]
  - "[Feature 3]" — [brief description]
  - "None for v1" — Defer entire category

Track responses:
- Selected features → v1 requirements
- Unselected table stakes → v2 (users expect these)
- Unselected differentiators → out of scope

**Identify gaps:**

Use AskUserQuestion:
- header: "Additions"
- question: "Any requirements recon missed? (Features specific to your vision)"
- options:
  - "No, recon covered it" — Proceed
  - "Yes, let me add some" — Capture additions

**Validate core value:**

Cross-check requirements against Core Value from brief.md. If gaps detected, surface them.

**Generate specs.md:**

Create `.ace/specs.md` with:
- v1 Requirements grouped by category (checkboxes, REQ-IDs)
- v2 Requirements (deferred)
- Out of Scope (explicit exclusions with reasoning)
- Traceability section (empty, filled by track)

**REQ-ID format:** `[CATEGORY]-[NUMBER]` (AUTH-01, CONTENT-02)

**Requirement quality criteria:**

Good requirements are:
- **Specific and testable:** "User can reset password via email link" (not "Handle password reset")
- **User-centric:** "User can X" (not "System does Y")
- **Atomic:** One capability per requirement (not "User can login and manage profile")
- **Independent:** Minimal dependencies on other requirements

Reject vague requirements. Push for specificity:
- "Handle authentication" → "User can log in with email/password and stay logged in across sessions"
- "Support sharing" → "User can share post via link that opens in recipient's browser"

**Present full requirements list:**

Show every requirement (not counts) for user confirmation:

```
## v1 Requirements

### Authentication
- [ ] **AUTH-01**: User can create account with email/password
- [ ] **AUTH-02**: User can log in and stay logged in across sessions
- [ ] **AUTH-03**: User can log out from any page

### Content
- [ ] **CONT-01**: User can create posts with text
- [ ] **CONT-02**: User can edit their own posts

[... full list ...]

---

Does this capture what you're building? (yes / adjust)
```

If "adjust": Return to scoping.

**Commit requirements:**

```bash
git add .ace/specs.md
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
docs: define v1 requirements

[Y] requirements deferred to v2
