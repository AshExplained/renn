<objective>
Create executable stage prompts (run.md files) for a track stage with integrated research and verification.

**Default flow:** Research (if needed) → Plan → Verify → Done

**Orchestrator role:** Parse arguments, validate stage, research domain (unless skipped or exists), spawn renn-architect agent, verify runs with renn-plan-reviewer, iterate until runs pass or max iterations reached, present results.

**Why subagents:** Research and planning burn context fast. Verification uses fresh context. User sees the flow between agents in main context.
</objective>

<execution_context>
@~/.claude/renn/references/ui-brand.md
@~/.claude/renn/workflows/plan-stage.md
</execution_context>

<context>
Stage number: $ARGUMENTS (optional - auto-detects next unplanned stage if not provided)

**Flags:**
- `--research` — Force re-research even if research.md exists
- `--skip-research` — Skip research entirely, go straight to planning
- `--gaps` — Gap closure mode (reads proof.md, skips research)
- `--skip-verify` — Skip architect → reviewer verification loop

Normalize stage input in step 2 before any directory lookups.
</context>

<process>
**Follow the plan-stage workflow** from `@~/.claude/renn/workflows/plan-stage.md`.

The workflow handles all planning logic including:

1. **Validate environment** — Check .renn/ exists, resolve horsepower profile
2. **Parse arguments** — Stage number, flags, normalize to zero-padded format
3. **Validate stage** — Confirm stage exists in track.md
4. **Ensure stage directory** — Create if needed, load intel.md early
5. **Handle research** — Scout spawning (unless --skip-research/--gaps/exists)
6. **Handle UI redirect** — Detect UI stages, check for design artifacts, redirect to /renn.design-system if missing
7. **Check existing runs** — Offer replan if runs exist
8. **Read context files** — Inline pulse, track, specs, intel, research, design for architect
9. **Spawn architect** — Create run.md files with planning context
10. **Handle architect return** — Route by completion status
11. **Spawn reviewer** — Verify runs achieve stage goal (unless --skip-verify)
12. **Handle reviewer return** — Pass or route to revision
13. **Revision loop** — Max 3 iterations of architect → reviewer
14. **Present final status** — Route to offer_next
